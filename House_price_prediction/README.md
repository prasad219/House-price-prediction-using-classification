House_pricing_prediction
==============================

The price of the flats in the city is increasing and there is so much of risk to predict the actual price of the house.Our model will helps you to predict the price of the house to a good accuracy. Our model will helps the clients to know the actual range of the house price based on the features of the properties ranging from (High,Medium,Low) and it will also helps the builders to know about the selling price that will fits the client needs.
